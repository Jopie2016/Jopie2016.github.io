                            My name is <strong>Jodi Pierre-Louis</strong>  and I am an aspiring web developer.  I love everything about sotware and tech and I even have my own podcast called <strong>Fragmented Tech Talks</strong>.  Software is a very important part of my life and I would love the opportunity to create my own.

                            I am <span style="background-color: yellow; border: thin solid black;">currently enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp</span> called the Software Guild and I plan on completeing it in July 2020.  During my time in the program I plan on acquiring front-end, back-end, fullstack, and java framework experience.  I am currently in cohort 9 with Tech Hire and I am excited to learn more and document my progress.

                        <h2><em>Past Experience</em></h2>
                        <p>
                            In the past I have gone the self-taught route and tried to teach myself coding.  I was able to learn a little about web development through youtube tutorials and udemy courses.  I do believe that learning in a bootcamp setting allows you to learn faster.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have also had the opportunity to teach whatever I learned to middle school children in Brooklyn for the past year and a half.  I believe that getting young children excited about tech and coding is essential in out society.  As we progress a society, technology plays a more significant role in our everyday lives.  The children are the future and its important to encourage innovation.

                        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                        <p>
                            I have a few hobbies that really excite me.  My favorite hobby is to code and to learning how to code.  I plan on building my own android app this year and a website to go along with it.  I feel like I have the freedom to do anything I would put my mind to with coding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two other hobbies that I enjoy are eating new foods and doing fantasy basketball leagues.  Food has always been an important part of my life and I believe it is a delicious art.  Enjoy new food is the equivalent of me listening to a beautifully composed song.  I also love being in my fantasy basketball league because its a way for me to be involved in the game and being competative without actually playing the game; life gets busy at times.
